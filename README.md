# Pacman-Game

Why Pacman?

Growing up, Pacman was one game I found myself countlessly playing across different gaming sites and consoles. Naturally, when I decided to do a personal project, the game was the first thing that came to mind. However, I wanted mine to be different than others as I felt that the maze layout of the Pacman games I had played before were either exactly the same, or pretty similar. The thing that also bugged me was the fact that I felt I never got an opportunity to play the game at different difficulty levels: there was always one set level and the ghosts appeared to behave similarly no matter how may times I played. I decided to make a version where the ghosts' actions differ based on the difficulty the player desires.

Why C++?

I decided to program this project using C++ as it provided benefits compared to other languages. For starters, I felt its standard template library (STL) would give me an edge in designing and programming the gameplay features, as compared to other languages. So did the fact that it is an object-oriented language, meaning I could utilize aspects such as inheritance and polymorphism, which I could not do with a language like C.
