# Pacman-Game

Why Pacman?

Growing up, Pacman was one game I found myself countlessly playing across different gaming sites and consoles. Naturally, when I decided to do a personal project, the game was the first thing that came to mind. However, I wanted mine to be different than others as I felt that the maze layout of the Pacman games I had played before were either exactly the same, or pretty similar. The thing that also bugged me was the fact that I felt I never got an opportunity to play the game at different difficulty levels: there was always one set level and the ghosts appeared to behave similarly no matter how may times I played. I decided to make a version where the ghosts' actions differ based on the difficulty the player desires.

Why C++?

I decided to program this project using C++ as it provided benefits compared to other languages.
